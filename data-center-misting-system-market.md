<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Data Center Misting System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Pressure Type</li><li>High Pressure Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The data center misting system market is primarily categorized into low-pressure and high-pressure types. Low-pressure misting systems operate at lower water pressures, producing larger water droplets that are suitable for larger areas but may consume more water. In contrast, high-pressure misting systems utilize higher pressures to create finer mist, which evaporates quickly and efficiently cools the environment with minimal water usage. Both types enhance cooling efficiency, reduce energy costs, and create a more stable operational climate in data centers.</p></p>
